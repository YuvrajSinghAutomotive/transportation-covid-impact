# CSE 5523: Machine Learning and Statistical Pattern Recognition

Final Project: Road Accident Severity Classification Using US Accidents Dataset

Yuvraj Singh (singh.1250) and Abdirashid Dahir (dahir.39)

## Abstract

Fewer drivers were on the roads during the onset of COVID-19 pandemic because of the stay-at-home mandates and workplace policies aimed at curbing the viral spread. These stay-at-home policies led to a significant reduction in car traffic, hence reducing urban traffic congestion. This study aims to classify the severity of road accidents using the US Accidents dataset ![link here](https://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents)
